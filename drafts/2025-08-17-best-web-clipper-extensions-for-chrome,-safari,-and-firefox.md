## What is a Web Clipper and Why Do You Need One?

A web clipper extension is a browser add-on that lets you instantly capture and save web content directly into another application, like a note-taking app or a dedicated read-it-later service. Instead of just saving a link, a great clipper allows you to:

*   **Clip a webpage** in its entirety, including text, images, and links.
*   Save a simplified, ad-free "article view" for clean, focused reading.
*   Capture a specific selection of text or a screenshot of a region.
*   Add tags, notes, and organizational context right at the moment of capture.

The primary benefit is efficiency. A web clipper eliminates the tedious copy-paste routine, preserving the original context and saving you precious time. It’s the bridge between browsing and building knowledge.
